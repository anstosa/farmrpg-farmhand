# Farm RPG Farmhand

Farmhand is an add-on that helps you all around Redbrook in [Farm RPG](https://farmrpg.com)

All features are configurable and optional.

## Usage

Note that Farmhand is designed to make navigating Redbrook and your FarmRPG life easier *in ways that do not violate the [Code of Conduct](https://farmrpg.com/index.php#!/coc.php)*.

> ### Botting, Scripting, Macros, Etc
>
> **Don't do it.**
>
> While Farm RPG is non-competitive, using any sort of script, bot, macro, etc to play the game in an automated fashion is strictly forbidden. Discussions involving this topic are also not allowed.
>
> The reason for this is that automating the game causes a large amount of server requests and bandwidth usage that is not ideal as the game grows.

Farmhand purposefully avoids any features that would violate the letter or spirit of these rules (such as auto-fish, auto-explore, auto-farm, etc). Usage of Farmhand should not result in a ban and has been unofficially okayed by admins *but is not explicitly endorsed by Magic & Wires LLC*. [@anstosa](https://farmrpg.com/#!/profile.php?user_name=anstosa) makes no warranties with regard to its use.

### Perk set management

If you have a perk set named "Default" and perk sets with the names "Crafting", "Fishing", "Exploring", "Selling", "Friendship", "Temple", "Locksmish", or "Wheel", they will be automatically activated before doing the relevant activities, and deactivated after.

Supports Quick Craft for "Crafting", Quick Sell for "Selling", and Quick Give for "Friendship"
